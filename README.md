# US YouTube Trending Video Analysis

This project explores the **US YouTube Trending Videos dataset** using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and data visualization techniques to understand trending behavior and engagement patterns.

## Objectives
- Analyze how quickly videos reach the Trending list (`days_to_trend`)
- Study engagement patterns using views, likes, and comments
- Examine whether title length and description length affect engagement
- Compare performance across different video categories
- Identify relationships between key engagement metrics

## Dataset
- Source: US YouTube Trending Videos dataset
- Key features include views, likes, comments, category, publish date, and derived metrics such as title length and days to trend

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
- Category-wise analysis using groupby and pivot tables
- Visualizations: histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, line charts, pie charts, box plots, and heatmaps

## Key Insights
- Most videos reach the Trending list quickly, though a few take much longer
- Views, likes, and comments are strongly correlated
- Title length and description length have little impact on engagement
- Video category plays a major role in overall performance

## Conclusion
